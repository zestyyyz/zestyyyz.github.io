    >Hello,&nbsp; my name is Brandon aka zesty online.&nbsp; I started using
    linux back in 2020 when i got a new laptop,&nbsp; it wasn&#39;t that great
    it only had a pentium with 4 gigs of ram,&nbsp; but because of how bad it
    was that made me want to improve performance.&nbsp; I started using linux
    the day after i got the laptop,&nbsp; I started with ubuntu and distrohopped
    so much once i started using linux.&nbsp; The distrohopping lasted for a
    long time,&nbsp; all of 2021 i was hopping.&nbsp; But in 2022 i decided to
    buy a chromebook and two days after i had it,&nbsp; the trackpad decided to
    die, so i returned it and purchased a 2010 macbook pro, which was my daily
    driver until i recently got a 2015 retina macbook pro 15 inch.&nbsp;
    (PS:this thing is a beast).&nbsp;</span
